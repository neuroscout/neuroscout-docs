# Running Neuroscout-CLI on Google Colab

A Google colab notebook is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neuroscout/neuroscout-cli/blob/master/examples/Neuroscout_Colab_Demo_NoMount.ipynb) where you can run a sample pre-generated analysis with an already provided id or provide your own analysis id. To run your own analysis, copy your id into the field in the cell labelled _1) Set Neuroscout Analysis ID_ and then run all of the cells. The provided id will run 10 subjects and 1 run from the Budapest dataset, and may take around 15 minutes. Larger analyses will take longer due to the limited free resources.
