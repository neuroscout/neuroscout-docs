# What is Neuroscout?

Neuroscout is an end-to-end platform for analysis of naturalistic public fMRI datasets.
With Neuroscout, you can choose among [dozens of naturalistic fMRI datasets](https://neuroscout.org/datasets) and easily build statistical models [on your browser](web/builder/intro.md) to analyze them. 
We provide [hundreds of pre-extracted predictors](https://neuroscout.org/predictors), but you can also upload custom features.
Analyses can be downloaded and executed it in one line of code using Neuroscout-CLI, and results are automatically uploaded to [NeuroVault](https://www.neurovault.org/).

Neuroscout leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to automatically annotate naturalistic stimuli, and uses [BIDS Stats Models](https://fitlins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model.html) and [FitLins](https://github.com/poldracklab/fitlins) to specify and consume statistical models.
[Analysis execution](cli/intro.md) is achieved with _minimal configuration_ using self-contained bundles and run-time data retrieval. Containerized _model-fitting pipelines_  minimize software dependencies and ensure _high portability_ across execution environments.
