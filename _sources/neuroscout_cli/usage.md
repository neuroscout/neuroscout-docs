# Neuroscout-CLI Usage

```{Note}
    If you're just starting out, we suggest you follow our [Docker quickstart](docker.md).
    Remember that if you're using Docker or Singularity, you will have to prepend the following
    commands with the respective container commands (e.g. `docker run -it neuroscout/neuroscout-cli`),
    and mount the appropriate volumes.
```

## Neuroscout-CLI commands
    
Neuroscout-CLI has three commands: `run`, `get` and `upload`.

By default, `run` will automatically use `get` to fetch the required inputs, and automatically `upload` results after execution.
Thus, in most cases, the `run` command is all you need.

Let's step through each command:


### Run

```
Usage: neuroscout run [OPTIONS] [FITLINS_OPTIONS]... ANALYSIS_ID OUT_DIR

  Run an analysis.

  Automatically gets inputs and uploads results to NeuroVault by default.

  This command uses FitLins for execution. Thus, any valid options can be
  passed through in [FITLINS_OPTIONS].

  Note: `--model`, `--derivatives` and `--ignore` and positional arguments
  are automatically configured.

  Example:

      neuroscout run --force-upload --n-cpus=3 a54oo /out

  If using Docker, remember to map local volumes to save outputs:

      docker run --rm -it -v /local/dir:/out neuroscout/neuroscout-cli run
      a54oo /out

Options:
  --download-dir PATH   Directory to cache input datasets, instead of OUT_DIR
  --no-get              Don't automatically fetch bundle & dataset
  --force-upload        Force upload even if a NV collection already exists
  --no-upload           Don't upload results to NeuroVault
  --upload-first-level  Upload first-level results, in addition to group
  --fitlins-help        Display FitLins help and options
  --help                Show this message and exit.
```

The run command will first call `get` to download the necessary data. 
Next, `run` will call FitLins for execution. As noted, you may pass any valid options to FitLins at runtime. 
To see which options are available in FitLins, use `--fitlins-help`.

Note that certain arguments to FitLins are automatically pre-set, as they are required by Neuroscout. 

After FitLins completes, `run` will automatically upload the results using the `upload` command.

See each command below for more detail on downloading inputs, and uploading results.


### Get

```
Usage: neuroscout get [OPTIONS] ANALYSIS_ID OUT_DIR

  Fetch analysis inputs.

  Downloads the analysis bundle, preprocessed fMRI inputs, and configures
  output directory.

  Inputs are downloaded to the output directory under `sourcedata`. If you
  run many analyses, you may wish to provide an `--download-dir` where
  datasets can be cached across analyses.

  Note: `run` automatically calls `get` prior to execution, by default.

Options:
  --download-dir PATH  Directory to cache input datasets, instead of OUT_DIR
  --bundle-only        Only fetch analysis bundle, not imaging data
  --help               Show this message and exit.
```

The `get` command prepares your system for analysis execution by 1) preparing the output directory, 2) downloading the analysis bundle (containing the BIDS StatsModel specification, event files, and more), and 3) downloading the preprocessed fMRI data. 

Note that only the specific files for that analysis will be download (i.e. only those runs/subjects)

By default, the input fMRI data is downloaded to the output directory under `sourcedata`, forming a fully re-executable output.
However, if you run many analyses with the same dataset, it can be useful to download the data to a common folder that can be re-used in other
analyses using `--download-dir`

For example:

    neuroscout get --download-dir /home/user/data a54oo /home/user/outputs

In this case, the fMRI dataset will be downloaded to `/home/user/data` and the output folder will be `/home/user/outputs/neuroscout-a54oo`,
with the bundle contents saved in the output folder.

```{Note}
    If you use the `get` command with `--download-dir`, be sure to also specify this directory when calling `run`, otherwise
    the data will be re-downloaded to the output directory.
```

### Upload

```
Usage: neuroscout upload [OPTIONS] ANALYSIS_ID OUT_DIR

  Upload results.

  This command can be used to upload existing results to NeuroVault.

  Note: `run` automatically calls `upload` after execution, by default.

Options:
  --force-upload        Force upload even if a NV collection already exists
  --no-upload           Don't upload results to NeuroVault
  --upload-first-level  Upload first-level results, in addition to group
  --help                Show this message and exit.
```

The `upload` command may be useful in case the `run` command experienced an error uploading results,
particularly if there was a connection error, and you wish to try again. 

Otherwise, it's typically reccomended to let the `run` command automatically upload results.
